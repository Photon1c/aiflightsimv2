   ```

3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## AI Backend Integration

The simulator connects to a local AI backend server for assistance:
- Default endpoint: http://localhost:3001
- Provides real-time flight suggestions
- Logs flight data and AI feedback
- Supports both aircraft and drone modes
- Simple ```node server.js``` command to run backend.

## Development
