## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## AI Backend Integration

The simulator connects to a local AI backend server for assistance:
- Default endpoint: http://localhost:3001
- Provides real-time flight suggestions
- Logs flight data and AI feedback
- Supports both aircraft and drone modes
- Simple ```node server.js``` command to run backend.

## Development

- Built with Three.js and Vite
- Uses PID controllers for flight stability
- Implements modular vehicle system
- Features responsive UI with draggable overlays

## Deployment

The project is configured for deployment on Netlify:
- Automatic builds from main branch
- Asset optimization and caching
- Security headers configured
- SPA routing support
